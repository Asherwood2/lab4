To run lab 4, run the Lab4Runnable file NOT the guiRunnable. The design patterns adapted were strategy and facade which were done in a new file for lab 4 in guiFoundation. 
The current state of the gui in lab 4 is unchanged from lab 3, I was not able to finish the gui in lab 3 but decided to use lab 3 since it was fresh on my mind.
Lab 3 repo can be found on its own on this GitHub, thank you for your time.
